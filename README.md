# Formhaus for Swift

A native Swift port of the [formhaus](https://github.com/ignsm/formhaus) form engine.

## Install

Add the package with Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ignsm/formhaus-swift.git", branch: "main"),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "App", dependencies: [.product(name: "FormhausCore", package: "formhaus-swift")]),
]
```

No version is tagged yet, so depend on `branch: "main"`. After the first tag, switch to `from: "<version>"`.

Requires Swift 6, iOS 16 or macOS 13. `FormhausCore` uses Foundation and JavaScriptCore, so it builds for Apple platforms only.

## Usage

```swift
import FormhausCore

let json = try JSONValue(parsing: data)

let issues = checkDefinition(json)
let definition = try FormDefinition(json: json)

let result = validateSubmission(definition, try JSONValue(parsing: body))
let localized = try localize(json, overlay: overlay).definition
let slots = textSlots(localized)

let engine = FormEngine(definition: definition, options: FormEngineOptions(
    onBeforeStepChange: { context in context.toStepId != "blocked" },
    onFormEvent: { event in print(event.type) }
))
engine.start()
engine.setValue("email", "ada@example.com")
if try await engine.next() {
    let sent = try await engine.submit { values, skippedSteps in
        let reply = try await api.send(values)
        return SubmitResult(json: reply)
    }
}
```

`FormEngine` is `@MainActor`. `checkDefinition`, `validateSubmission`, `localize` and `textSlots` run on any thread.

## API

`FormEngine` follows the `FormEngine` class of `@formhaus/core` and keeps its names.

- State: `values`, `errors`, `topLevelErrors`, `stepErrors`, `currentStep`, `currentStepIndex`, `visibleSteps`, `visibleFields`, `visibleNodes`, `isFirstStep`, `isLastStep`, `isMultiStep`, `canGoNext`, `progress`, `submitting`, `stepValidating`, `fieldLoading`, `items(_:)`, `isStepSkipped(_:)`, `getSubmitValues()`.
- Values: `setValue`, `setItemValue`, `addItem`, `removeItem`, `reset`.
- Errors: `validate`, `validateField`, `setErrors`, `setFieldLoading`.
- Navigation: `start`, `next`, `back`, `skip(_:)`, `submit(_:)`, `goToStepWithField`, `cancelPendingActions`. `next`, `back`, `skip` and `submit` are `async throws` and return `Bool`, like the promises in TypeScript.
- Changes: `subscribe(_:)` calls the listener after every state change and returns a function that cancels the subscription. A listener added during a notification is called in it, and one removed before its turn is not.

`FormEngineOptions` holds `onBeforeStepChange`, `onAfterStepChange`, `onBeforeSubmit`, `onAfterSubmit`, `onStepValidate`, `onFormEvent`, `onWarning`, `validators` and `messages`. Hooks are `@MainActor @Sendable` and `async throws`. A hook that returns `Bool?` cancels with `false`, and `nil` stands for `undefined`. A submit handler returns `SubmitResult?`: `.ok`, `.rejected(errors:formErrors:)` or `nil`. `SubmitResult(json:)` reads the `{ ok, errors, formErrors }` object that a TypeScript handler returns. An error thrown by `onAfterStepChange` or `onAfterSubmit` comes back as `FormLifecycleError` with its `phase` and `cause`. A `CancellationError` thrown by a hook or submit handler is never rethrown: the action returns `false` and clears `stepValidating` and `submitting`.

## Status

- Definition corpus: passing. `checkDefinition` errors and warnings, overlays, text slots and value cases for the server and the browser engine.
- Engine scenarios: passing. Every scenario in `Fixtures/conformance/scenarios` runs through `FormEngine` as its own test, named `<file>: <scenario>`.

The conformance fixtures live in `Tests/FormhausCoreTests/Fixtures/conformance`. They are pinned to formhaus commit `ec53afff48308581ca1e7037b3759ebc26e7b623`. A tag will replace the commit once a `@formhaus/core` release contains the suite. `Fixtures/VERSION` records the ref and the resolved sha. To sync again:

```sh
scripts/sync-fixtures.sh <git-ref> [path-to-formhaus-repo]
```

## Differences from @formhaus/core

- Patterns compile with JavaScriptCore's `RegExp`. Syntax added to JavaScript after the installed OS version of JavaScriptCore can behave differently than in Node.
- If a pattern match throws inside JavaScriptCore, the value fails the pattern rule. `@formhaus/core` lets the value pass.
- The JSON parser rejects strings with unpaired surrogate escapes such as `"\uD800"`. Swift `String` cannot hold them, and replacing them with U+FFFD would change the value.
- The JSON parser rejects documents nested deeper than 512 levels (`JSONValue.maxNestingDepth`). Swift compares and frees nested values recursively, so deeper values could overflow the stack.
- `JSONValue` equality compares structure. A new array or object with the same contents counts as the same value, where JavaScript compares object identity. `FormEngine` keeps the JavaScript rule: every array or object passed to `setValue` or `setItemValue` counts as a change, and group items keep their identity across edits.
- Without `onWarning`, definition warnings go to `os.Logger` with subsystem `dev.formhaus`. `@formhaus/core` logs them with `console.warn`.
- Hooks are always `async`. A TypeScript hook can also return a plain value. The engine suspends after every hook call, as TypeScript does at each `await`, so main-actor tasks queued during an action run before it continues, even when the hook returns at once.
- `FieldErrors` holds strings. A TypeScript `onStepValidate` can return other values, which the engine keeps as they are.

## Scenario runner

`Tests/FormhausCoreTests/Scenarios` ports the TypeScript scenario runner. Each action runs as a main-actor task. Waiting "one macrotask" means yielding the main actor until every task that is not blocked on a `defer` reply has run. A `defer` reply is a continuation that the `resolve` step resumes. The runner fails on unknown action, hook and expectation names, on actions that never settle, and on `defer` replies that are never resolved.
